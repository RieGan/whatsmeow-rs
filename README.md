use whatsmeow::{
    Client, 
    auth::{AuthState, AuthManager, PairingMethod},
    store::{MemoryStore, DeviceStore}, 
    types::{Event, SendableMessage, TextMessage, JID}
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create store and client
    let store: Arc<dyn DeviceStore> = Arc::new(MemoryStore::new());
    let client = Client::new(store);
    
    // Add event handler
    client.add_event_handler(Box::new(|event| {
        match event {
            Event::Connected => println!("Connected to WhatsApp!"),
            Event::QRCode { code } => {
                println!("Scan this QR code with WhatsApp: {}", code);
            },
            Event::AuthenticationComplete { registration } => {
                println!("Successfully authenticated device: {:?}", registration.jid);
            },
            Event::Message(msg) => println!("Received: {:?}", msg),
            _ => println!("Event: {:?}", event),
        }
        true
    })).await;
    
    // Connect and authenticate
    client.connect().await?;
    
    match client.auth_state().await {
        AuthState::Unauthenticated => {
            let qr_code = client.generate_qr().await?;
            println!("QR Code: {}", qr_code);
        },
        AuthState::AuthenticatedMultiDevice(registration) => {
            // Send a message
            let jid: JID = "1234567890@s.whatsapp.net".parse()?;
            let message = SendableMessage::Text(TextMessage {
                text: "Hello from Rust!".to_string(),
            });
            client.send_message(&jid, message).await?;
        },
        _ => {}
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Advanced Authentication Management

```rust
use whatsmeow::auth::{AuthManager, PairingMethod, QREvent};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create authentication manager
    let mut auth_manager = AuthManager::new();
    
    // Start background services (session validation, device cleanup)
    auth_manager.start_services().await?;
    
    // Start QR code pairing
    auth_manager.start_pairing(PairingMethod::QRCode)?;
    let qr_code = auth_manager.generate_qr().await?;
    println!("Scan QR: {}", qr_code);
    
    // Handle QR events in real-time
    while let Some(event) = auth_manager.next_qr_event().await {
        match event {
            QREvent::CodeGenerated { code, expires_at } => {
                println!("New QR: {} (expires: {:?})", code, expires_at);
            }
            QREvent::Scanned => {
                println!("QR code was scanned!");
                break;
            }
            QREvent::Expired => {
                println!("QR code expired, generating new one...");
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Complete authentication
    let jid = "your_phone_number@s.whatsapp.net".parse()?;
    let registration = auth_manager.complete_auth(jid, "server_token".to_string()).await?;
    println!("Authentication complete: {:?}", registration);
    
    Ok(())
