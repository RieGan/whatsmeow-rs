# whatsmeow-rs

A comprehensive Rust client library for the WhatsApp Web multidevice API, ported from the Go library [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow).

> **Note**: This port was developed with assistance from AI to accelerate the translation from Go to Rust while maintaining architectural integrity and following Rust best practices.

## Usage

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use whatsmeow::{
    Client, 
    auth::AuthState,
    store::{MemoryStore, DeviceStore}, 
    types::{Event, SendableMessage, TextMessage, JID}
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create store and client
    let store: Arc<dyn DeviceStore> = Arc::new(MemoryStore::new());
    let client = Client::new(store);
    
    // Add event handler
    client.add_event_handler(Box::new(|event| {
        match event {
            Event::Connected => println!("Connected to WhatsApp!"),
            Event::QRCode { code } => {
                println!("Scan this QR code with WhatsApp: {}", code);
            },
            Event::LoggedIn => println!("Successfully authenticated!"),
            Event::Message(msg) => println!("Received: {:?}", msg),
            _ => println!("Event: {:?}", event),
        }
        true
    })).await;
    
    // Connect and authenticate
    client.connect().await?;
    
    match client.auth_state().await {
        AuthState::Unauthenticated => {
            let qr_code = client.generate_qr().await?;
            println!("QR Code: {}", qr_code);
        },
        AuthState::Authenticated(_) => {
            // Send a message
            let jid: JID = "1234567890@s.whatsapp.net".parse()?;
            let message = SendableMessage::Text(TextMessage {
                text: "Hello from Rust!".to_string(),
            });
            client.send_message(&jid, message).await?;
        },
        _ => {}
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
